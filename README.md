🧾 Project Explanation: E-Commerce Analytics Data Warehouse (dbt)

 🛒 Blinkit Sales Analytics — dbt + Snowflake + Looker Studio

Welcome to the Blinkit Sales Analytics project, a modern data stack pipeline powered by dbt, Snowflake, and Looker Studio. This project transforms raw Blinkit operational data into actionable insights to track customer behavior, marketing ROI, delivery performance, and product profitability.

 🧠 Project Purpose
This project builds a modular, well-documented transformation layer using dbt on Snowflake, enabling interactive reporting in Looker Studio. It follows the best practices of staging, intermediate modeling, and data marts.\\
📌 Project Purpose
This dbt project transforms raw transactional, customer, and marketing data into analytics-ready tables that support business intelligence and reporting for an e-commerce company. The models focus on key areas like:
Customer churn and acquisition


Product profitability


Delivery performance


Marketing effectiveness


Regional order and rating statistics


It ensures data is modeled consistently and reliably, with testing and documentation built into the data pipeline.

🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

🔹 Step 1: Define Data Sources
File(s):
sources.yml


What Happens:
You declare raw source tables from your warehouse (e.g., orders, customers, products).


These source definitions include metadata and freshness checks.



🔹 Step 2: Stage Raw Data
Folder: stagging/ (typo – should be staging/)
 Key Functions:
Clean column names


Cast data types


Apply initial filters


Add surrogate keys (surrogate_key_inven.sql)


Outcome:
 Clean, trusted base tables for transformations.

🔹 Step 3: Build Intermediate Logic
Folder: intermediate/
 Purpose:
Join tables


Apply business logic (e.g., customer lifetime, time windows)


Aggregate complex metrics


Prepare datasets for final marts


Outcome:
 Reusable, modular SQL layers.

🔹 Step 4: Create Data Marts
Folder: data_mart/
 Model Files:
mart_customer_chrun_rate.sql


mart_area_order_stats.sql


mart_product_profits.sql


mart_delivery_performance.sql


mart_marketing_stats.sql


mart_new_user_montly.sql


mart_product_details.sql


mart_area_ratings.sql


Purpose:
Final, business-ready tables for dashboards and BI tools


Optimized for fast querying


Aligned to KPIs




mart_new_user_montly.sql


mart_marketing_stats.sql


Serve dashboards and self-service analytics


Seeds & Snapshots:


seeds/ may include mapping tables, lookup values, or static reference data


snapshots/ track historical changes in slowly changing dimensions (e.g., customer status over time)


Testing & Documentation:


customer_metrics.yml and sources.yml define:


Schema tests (nulls, uniqueness, referential integrity)


Documentation for models, columns, and relationships


Run with dbt test and dbt docs serve
